1.
For policy iteration, I kept a 2D array of all the updated values after sweeping through the policy array which I used to update the policy array after calculating new values for all cells.
To test for convergence, I simply checked if this 2D array matched the policy array from the previous iteration.

2.
For value iteration, I used the same method as policy iteration - simply check if the cell values match the cell values calculated in the previous iteration.
